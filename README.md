# Image Prediction Using ImageAI

Image prediction or image recognition is an application of Computer Vision which is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to derive meaningful information from digital images.

This is a project on Image Prediction using ImageAI. The algorithm used for the image prediction is **Inceptionv3** by Google Brain team. Other algorithms inclule; **MobileNetV2, ResNet50, DenseNet21**. Links to these algorithms can be found [_here_](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/blob/master/imageai/Classification/README.md)

From the predictions run in the *imagerecog.py* file, the Model here is pretty sure that it is a boathouse by about 93%.
```
boathouse  :  92.79947876930237
